# Data-Analyst-Call-center
Analysed the given call-center dataset in excel and verified if any data is missing or incomplete. 
After analyzing the dataset connected  with Power BI through excel.
After connecting the dataset my first step was to create 2 columns named as #Answered and #Resolved.
That went to transformation data and created 2 conditional column named as #Answered and #Resolved to get the accurate outcome.
Created a unique Power Bi dashboard  to identify the total calls received by the agents, no.of resolved call, avg speed of answering call in second, avg satisfaction rate, no.of called answered.
With this dashboard we can easily identify the performance given by the agents and the support given to the customers int he different topics.
